## Running the App

You must have React and its dependencies (Node.js, NDM) installed in order to run this app.

After cloning the repository and making sure dependencies are installed, navigate to the folder locally, then run the following command:

```bash
$ npm start
```
The app should open in your preferred browser.


## Functionality

Cheezy is a social media website that allows users to upload photos.
Along with a photo url, each photo post is also associated with the poster's name, their profile picture, and a caption for the photo.

After a photo is posted, a React component is created that allows users to:
- Add comments to the post.
- Like the post.
- Cheese the post.
- Overlay photos with filters that can be previewed, applied, and reverted back.


## User Interface

Here are a few examples of different states of the app during runtime.
